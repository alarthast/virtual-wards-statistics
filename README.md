## NHS Virtual Ward Statistics Dashboard

This is a simplistic dashboard created as part of a job application. The aim is to demonstrate skills in constructing ETL pipelines, building visualisations and handling healthcare data. While this dashboard was built using Dash, I am confident that I can pick up other visualisation/BI tools such as Looker, Tableau or Power BI swiftly. I have actually recently attained a professional certificate in Power BI issued by Microsoft (on Coursera)!

The dashboard is currently deployed on Heroku: https://virtual-ward-stats-a74031e43897.herokuapp.com/.
