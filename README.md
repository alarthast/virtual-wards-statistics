## NHS Virtual Ward Statistics Dashboard

This is a mini-dashboard created as part of a job application. The aim is to demonstrate skills and development potential in constructing ETL pipelines, building visualisations and handling healthcare data. While this dashboard was built using Dash, I am confident that I can pick up other visualisation/BI tools such as Looker, Tableau or Power BI swiftly. I have actually recently attained a professional certificate in Power BI issued by Microsoft (on Coursera)!

The dashboard is currently deployed on Heroku: https://virtual-ward-stats-a74031e43897.herokuapp.com/. 

The majority of the work is currently on the develop branch: While the dashboard is fully functional, I intend to complete the docstrings and code formatting before merging to main.
